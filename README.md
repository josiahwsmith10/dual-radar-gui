# dual-radar-gui
Graphical user interface for controlling the dual radar scanner used in paper titled "Deep Learning-Based Multiband Signal Fusion for 3-D SAR Super-Resolution" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02017), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2023.3270111))

## Accompanying code
Please refer to [dual-radar-synchronizer](https://github.com/josiahwsmith10/dual-radar-synchronizer) for ESP32 code for synchronizing dual radar platform

## TODO
- Change references to radar-imaging-toolbox-prive repository to use [THz-and-Sub-THz-Imaging-Toolbox](https://github.com/josiahwsmith10/THz-and-Sub-THz-Imaging-Toolbox)
- Release pretrained models and code
